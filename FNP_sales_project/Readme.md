### ⚙️ Project Workflow

The creation of this dashboard followed a structured and methodical approach:

1.  **Data Inception & Preparation:** The three CSV files were imported into Excel. The data was scrupulously cleaned and formatted to ensure consistency and accuracy, preparing a solid foundation for analysis.

2.  **Data Modelling & Processing:** Key columns were created using Excel formulas to facilitate deeper analysis. For instance, `Revenue` was calculated by multiplying `Quantity` and `Price (INR)`, and `Delivery Time` was derived by subtracting the `Order_Date` from the `Delivery_Date`.

3.  **Analysis & Aggregation:** Pivot Tables were extensively used to summarise the data, calculate the key metrics, and answer the business questions outlined in the project's objectives.

4.  **Visualisation & Dashboard Design:** The aggregated data was translated into a suite of intuitive charts and graphs. These visual elements were then artfully arranged onto a single sheet, creating a cohesive and interactive dashboard. Slicers were added to allow for effortless data filtering by occasion, product, and more.
